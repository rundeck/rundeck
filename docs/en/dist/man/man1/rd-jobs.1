.SH NAME
.PP
rd-jobs - List or load jobs to the RunDeck server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
dispatch [\f[I]action\f[]] [\f[I]action options\f[]]\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The dispatch command is used to remotely execute ad-hoc shell
commands on a set of nodes which are specified by the filter
options.
.PP
The rd-jobs command lists Jobs stored on the server and optionally
downloads them as XML, or uploads Job XML to the server from a
file.
.PP
The tool works in one of two \f[I]ACTION\f[] modes:
.IP \[bu] 2
list : list the stored Jobs on the server (default action)
.IP \[bu] 2
load : upload XML job definitions up to the server
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
-h, --help : Print usage message.
.PP
-v : Run verbosely.
.SS LIST ACTION OPTIONS
.PP
-g, --group \f[I]GROUP\f[] : Group name.
List jobs within this group or sub-group
.PP
-i, --idlist \f[I]ID\f[] : Job ID List.
List Jobs with these IDs explicitly.
Comma-separated, e.g.: 1,2,3.
.PP
-n, --name \f[I]NAME\f[] : Job Name.
List jobs matching this name.
.PP
-p, --project \f[I]PROJECT\f[] : Project name.
List jobs within this project.
.PP
-f, --file \f[I]FILE\f[] : File path.
For list action, path to store the job definitions found in XML.
.SH LOAD ACTION OPTIONS
.PP
-d, --duplicate \f[I]update|skip|create\f[] : Duplicate job
behavior option.
When loading jobs, treat definitions that already exist on the
server in the given manner: `update' existing jobs,`skip' the
uploaded definitions, or `create' them anyway.
(load action.
default: update)
.PP
-f, --file \f[I]FILE\f[] : File path.
For load action, path to an XML FILE to upload.
.SH LIST ACTION
.PP
The List action queries the server for a list of matching jobs, and
displays the result list.
Optionally the definitions of the matching jobs can be stored in a
file if \f[C]-f\f[] is specified.
.PP
The jobs can be specifed explicitly by ID using the
\f[C]-i/--idlist\f[] option.
Otherwise they are searched using the options as filter criteria,
and all matching Jobs are returned.
.PP
If no options to the list action are supplied, then all Jobs on the
server are returned.
.PP

rd-jobs\ -i\ 123
\f[]
.fi
.PP
List a set of jobs by ID and store them in a file:
.IP
.nf

Found\ 5\ jobs:
\ \ \ 1:\ Build\ all\ [38]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/38>
\ \ \ 2:\ Build\ and\ Update\ Server0\ [31]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/31>

\ \ \ 5:\ Deploy\ Server4\ [46]\ <http://localhost:8080/rundeck/scheduledExecution/show/46>
\f[]
.fi
.SH LOAD ACTION
.PP
The Load action uploads the specified file to the server, and the
list of loaded jobs are displayed.
If any Jobs cannot be stored (e.g.
the user is unauthorized to run a certain command), the list of
unsuccessfully created jobs are also displayed.
.PP
The \f[C]-d,\\--duplicate\f[] option lets you specify what should
happen if any of the Job definitions have the same Name and Group
of an existing Job on the server.
The default option is \[lq]update\[rq], which means to overwrite
the existing definitions with the new version.
\[lq]skip\[rq] means to ignore the uploaded definition.
\[lq]create\[rq] means to create a new Job with the uploaded
definition (hence making the Group+Name non-unique).
