Release 2.6.3
===========

Date: 2016-02-25

Name: <span style="color: dodgerblue"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-leaf"></span> "cafe bonbon dodgerblue leaf"</span>

## Notes

Primarily bug fixes, and some enhancements:

* Asynchronous nodes cache. Per-project and global toggle and configurable retention delay.
By default, projects now use an asynchronous method for	retrieving Node data from Resource Model Sources. 
You should see an improvement in page load when using slow model sources (such as a URL for a slow endpoint).
* Performance improvements with many thousands of Nodes.  The Nodes and Commands page, as well as other places
where Nodes are loaded (e.g. Job editor) now should be much more responsive when you have e.g. 20K nodes.
The Nodes page now uses result paging, and some parts of the UI now truncate the result set as well if you have many nodes.

## Upgrading


Upgrading from 2.5 should not cause any issues. Some new database fields were added, and a new database table was added.

## Compatibility

Some changes to Job serialization formats:

* The project name is no longer included in exported Job definitions.
* In YAML: options are now always serialized as a sequence, and will preserve the sequence order on input. The original Map format is still allowed on import.

Release 2.5.0
=============

Date: 2015-04-15

Name: <span style="color: saddlebrown"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-grain"></span> "cafe au lait saddlebrown grain"</span>

This release has many new features and bugfixes, and contains some refactoring under the hood.

## New Features

* Upgraded grails framework, which adds support for Java 8 (and removes Java 6)
* Can now store Project definition and configuration in the database (optional), see [Project Definitions](http://rundeck.org/2.5.0/administration/project-setup.html#project-definitions) and information in the [Upgrade Guide](http://rundeck.org/2.5.0/upgrading/index.html).
* Improved GUI for administering a project: modify Project configuration file contents, and readme.md/motd.md contents. Project archiving is also now performed asynchronously.
* New Jasypt encryption plugin can be used for Key Storage and Project Configuration, see [Jasypt Encryption Converter Plugin](http://rundeck.org/2.5.0/plugins-user-guide/storage-plugins.html#jasypt-encryption-converter-plugin)
* Support Key Storage password for SSH sudo and SSH private key passphrase
* New workflow step plugin: Assert state of another Job, optionally halt workflow with custom status string
* New `rd-acl` commandline tool can list test and generate .aclpolicy file contents, see [rd-acl](http://rundeck.org/2.5.0/man1/rd-acl.html)
* New Orchestrator plugin point. Orchestrators can be used to batch and sequence the matched nodes used in node dispatching, e.g.: only allow a certain % to run simultaneously.
	* [Plugins User Guide -  Orchestrator Plugins](http://rundeck.org/2.5.0/plugins-user-guide/orchestrator-plugins.html)
	* [Plugin Developer Guide -  Orchestrator Plugin](http://rundeck.org/2.5.0/developer/orchestrator-plugin.html)
	* [Example code](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/tree/development/examples/example-java-orchestrator-plugin)
* Added hybrid LDAP + properties file group authentication for JAAS (`JettyCombinedLdapLoginModule`)
	* [Administration - Authentication - Combining LDAP with other modules](http//rundeck.org/2.5.0/administration/authenticating-users.html#combining-ldap-with-other-modules)

## Upgrading

**Note:** We've attempted to maintain compatibility with previous plugins, but due to changes in the core library,
Rundeck may have issues loading or running some plugins.

Please report issues found to [Github issues](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/issues).

See the [Upgrading Guide](http://rundeck.org/2.5.0/upgrading/index.html)

Release 2.4.0
=============

Date: 2014-12-16

Name: <span style="color: indigo"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-briefcase"></span> "americano indigo briefcase"</span>

This release has bug fixes and new features, including some GUI improvements.

## New Features

* Job references can override Node Filters. See updates to [XML](../man5/job-xml.html#jobref) and [YAML](../man5/job-yaml.html#job-reference-entry) job definition formats as well.
* Job and Option descriptions can contain markdown and HTML. For Jobs, the first line is the short description, and following lines are interpreted as markdown.
* MSSQL compatibility
* Some GUI tweaks and changes
    * A new Action menu is available next to the Job name in job listing and view pages.  Actions include Edit, Duplicate, Delete, and download XML/YAML definitions.
    * The Delete Job link in the Job Edit page has been removed
    * The Job Edit link in job lists has been replaced with an Action menu
    * Hovering on job name in job lists now triggers the detail popup after a slight delay. Previously it was triggered by hovering on the Edit link.
    * Execution follow page layout has been rearranged
    * Added extended Job descriptions (sanitized Markdown/html)
    * Job Edit/Create page: you are now asked to confirm navigation away from the page if you have made changes to the Job

## Incubator features

* Parallel step execution
    - this can be enabled with `rundeck-config.properties` entry:

            feature.incubator.parallelWorkflowStrategy=true

* ssh-agent forwarding for ssh connections
    - this can be enabled per node, project, or server
        framework.properties:

            framework.local.ssh-agent=<true|false>
            framework.local.ttl-ssh-agent=<time in sec>

        project.properties:

            project.local.ssh-agent=<true|false>
            project.local.ttl-ssh-agent=<time in sec>

        Node properties:

            local-ssh-agent=<true|false>
            local-ttl-ssh-agent=<time in sec>

## Compatibility notes


A bug in API v11 XML responses caused them to sometimes be incorrectly wrapped in a `<result>` element, this has now been corrected.  See the [API Docs](../api/index.html) for information.  The Rundeck API Java Client library has been updated to workaround this issue (for previous versions of Rundeck).

## What is "americano indigo briefcase"?

New versions of Rundeck will have a name based on the version number. The 2.x theme is Coffee, and 2.4.x is "americano". The point release defines a combination of color and icon we can display in the GUI for easier visual differentiation. 2.4.0 is "indigo briefcase".

> Why yes, I'd like an americano, thank you.

Release 2.3.0
=============

Date: 2014-10-28

* Improved support for use of Windows, both as a Rundeck server 
    and a remote node.
    * Fixed outstanding issues with CLI .bat scripts
    * Support powershell scripts by allowing configuration
        of file extension to be used in workflow script steps. 
        E.g use ".ps1" because powershell will not execute a script 
        that doesn't end in .ps1.
    * Other fixes for issues with script-based plugins and Windows paths.
* Added support for storing Passwords in the Key Storage facility.  
    The built-in SSH execution and SCP file copy 
    both now support using stored passwords.
    Note: the Key Storage facility is not encrypted by default, see
    [Key Storage](http://rundeck.org/docs/administration/key-storage.html).
* Added a new GUI for uploading Passwords and public/private keys
    to the Key Storage facility
* Bug fixes
* Disable SSLv3 by default

* [plugin development: plugin properties using rendering options should allow String values](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/issues/939)

Release notes from 2.2.2 follow:

This release fixes a number of bugs and addresses several potential security issues:

1. Require a unique token for each form request from the GUI, which prevents replay and CSRF attacks
2. Updated all pages to prevent unencoded data from being written to the response, preventing XSS style attacks.
3. Prevent access to the /api URLs via the web GUI.
4. Some plugins (Resource model, Node Executor and File Copier) now support using Password fields displayed in the Project config page. The field values once set are never revealed in clear text via the GUI.

Please see the Notes below for some configuration information
related to these changes.

**A big Thank You to one of our clients for sponsoring the work for these enhancements.**

*Security Notes:*

The new form tokens used in all form requests
by default will expire in 30 minutes.
This means that if your session timeout is larger than 30 minutes
and you attempt to e.g. run a job
after your web page has been sitting open for longer than that,
you will see an "Invalid token" error.
If this becomes a problem for you
you can either change the expiration time for these tokens,
or switch to using non-expiring tokens.
See [Administration - Configuration File Reference - Security](http://rundeck.org/2.2.2/administration/configuration-file-reference.html#security).

To add a Password field definition to your plugin, 
see [Plugin Development - Description Properties](http://rundeck.org/2.2.2/developer/plugin-development.html#description-properties). 
(Note that currently using property annotations is not supported 
for the three plugin types that can use Password properties.)

*Upgrade notes:* 

See the [Upgrading Guide](http://rundeck.org/2.2.2/upgrading/index.html).

Release 2.2.1
=============

Date: 2014-07-30

Bugfix release.

*Upgrade notes:* 

See the [Upgrading Guide](http://rundeck.org/2.2.1/upgrading/index.html).

## Contributors

* Greg Schueler (gschueler)

---

Release 2.2.0
=============

Date: 2014-07-11

New features:

* Job timeout: specify a maximum duration for a job. If the job execution exceeds this duration, it will be halted (as if killed manually). You can use a simple format like "120m" (120 minutes) or "2h" (2 hours).  You can specify the timeout via a job option by setting it to `${option.name}`.  This only affects the job when executed directly, not when run as a job reference.
* Job retry: specify a maximum retry attempt for a job.  If the job fails or is timed out, it will be retried.  The maximum value can be specified via a job option if set to `${option.name}`.
* Delete executions: delete executions individually or in bulk. Requires a 'delete_execution' action allowed via aclpolicy.

Some bug fixes are included, as well as some pull requests to enhance the LDAP login module:

* Support nested LDAP group membership (see [Added support for nested groups in JettyCachingLdapLoginModule.](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/pull/829))
* Support a "supplementalRoles" setting, which can help avoid the `!role` issue. See [Login Module Configuration](http://rundeck.org/2.2.0/administration/authenticating-users.html#login-module-configuration).

*Upgrade notes:* 

Several domain fields were added. Mysql and H2 should upgrade in place without issue.

automatically update the VARCHAR size when you upgrade.

* If you are using a different database (mysql, etc.), you will have
to update your schema manually.
* If you are using H2, you can use this
script to update your database:

    1. Shutdown rundeck
    2. Run [rundeck-2.0.2-h2-upgrade.sh](https://gist.github.com/gschueler/9534814#file-rundeck-2-0-2-h2-upgrade-sh)

Release 2.0.0
===========

Date: 2014-01-31

Rundeck 2.0.0 introduces a large number of major changes. We have revamped the
entire UI and overhauled the underpinnings. Our goals were to improve the user
experience and cut down some of the technical debt which had accrued.

Note that the documentation is still being updated. We will update it as it improves at <http://rundeck.org/2.0.0>

Before you upgrade to Rundeck 2.0, please be sure to read the Upgrading Guide
located in the documentation.

Many thanks to everyone who was able to contribute ideas, feedback, code, time
or money in helping us to improve Rundeck.

## Notable Changes

* New feature: live execution state view
    * Live view of job executions to see what step is running on which node.
    * Instantly drill in to view the output for the step and node that failed
    * View node metrics and collated output.
    * **Please give a big thank-you to (an anonymous) "sponsored development client" for funding the work for this feature!**
* New Projects home page displays readme and message of the day files that can be customized with markdown to display notices to users
* Improved Node filter
    * Now supports all custom node attributes
    * New filter expression syntax, simple examples: 
        - `tags: a+b` filters by tags
        - `environment: (prod|qa)` Regular expression filter on an attribute called `environment`
    * New simpler UI
* Improved Nodes page to better navigate the data about the nodes in your infrastructure
    * Navigate nodes through attribute links
    * Run a job or execute a command from filter sets
* New Commands page dedicated to ad hoc command execution.
    * Controls over thread count and error handling
    * Reference saved defined filters or express your own.
* Step descriptions for workflow steps. Give your step a brief description, which will be displayed during execution.
* Improved Activity views with tabbed views for common queries
    * Tabs for Now running, recent, errors and executions by you.
* Box score metrics for executions. Use Rundeck as an information radiator.
    * Percent completed and Success/Failure metrics displayed for each execution 

## Enhancements

* New coat of paint: new logo, new GUI style using Bootstrap 3 and Flatly theme
* Caching and error catching for resource model source plugins
* Execution model API and json representation stored with log output
* Optimized internals to reduce service loading time
* Cruft removal (legacy formats and syntaxes), upgraded frameworks
* Copy file step plugin copies files from rundeck server to remote nodes.
* API
    * Better REST-ful behavior
    * removed use of 302 redirects between requests and some responses
* JDK7 support

Release 1.6.0
===========

Date: 2013-08-02

Rundeck 1.6.0 introduces two major changes and a number of bug fixes and enhancements:

* Logging system plugins.
    * New facility allows integration with other systems, like Logstash, and improves Rundeck's behavior in a clustered cloud environment by allowing you to have log files synched to a shared storage more easily.
* Refreshed GUI
    * Did you know it hasn't really been changed since Rundeck 1.0?!  We fixed some of the usability complaints about the old GUI, and our goal was to address usability without having to change functionality, but some of our future GUI enhancement ideas snuck in.

Notable issues:

* [Allow scripts to be run as sudo](https://github.com/dtolabs/rundeck/issues/343) - popular request!
* [Use defaults for optional parameter values, and expand to blank value when missing](https://github.com/dtolabs/rundeck/issues/352) - More intuitive and less annoying!

Many thanks for the helpful contributions from the community!

Release 1.5
===========

Date: 2/21/2013

This release introduces a few new features and some bug fixes. The new features
required  some schema changes to the database, so direct upgrading from 1.4 to
1.5 is not possible.   Please read the Upgrading document for upgrade
information.

There is now a new type of plugin, the Workflow Step Plugin, which should allow
rundeck  workflows to integrate with more systems in a more direct fashion.
These plugins can be  either "Workflow Steps" (run once per workflow) or "Node
Steps" (run once per node in a workflow.)

Steps can now have Error Handlers which run if the step fails. They will be
provided with context data about the reason the step failed.

Notable Changes:

* Step Plugins - Plugins can now be created and used for workflow or node steps.
* Error Handlers - Each step in a workflow can now have an error handler that
* will be run if the step fails.  bug fix: Job references in a workflow will now
* only run once, and not operate as a node-step.

Plugin developers:

You will need to update your plugins to work in Rundeck 1.5. Refer to the
Developer Guide for more information.
