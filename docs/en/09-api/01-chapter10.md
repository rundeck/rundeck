RunDeck API
===========

RunDeck provides a Web API for use with your application.  This describes the RunDeck API version `1`.

URLs
----

The RunDeck server has a "Base URL", where you access the server. Your RunDeck Server URL may look like: `http://myserver:4440`.

The root URL path for all calls to the API in this version is:

    $RUNDECK_SERVER_URL/api/1

In this document we will leave off the `$RUNDECK_SERVER_URL/api/1` and simply display URLs as `/...`.

XML
----

The majority of API calls require XML for input and output.  Some import/export features support YAML formatted documents, but XML is used for all API-level information.  (JSON support is planned for a future API version.)

Authentication
-----

Authentication is required prior to access to the API.  This means that you must submit authentication parameters (username, password) to the "Authentication URL" and retain a Session Cookie. 

The Session Cookie must be sent with all calls to the API to maintain the authenticated connection.

To submit authentication, submit a `POST` request to the URL:
    
    $RUNDECK_SERVER_URL/j_security_check

With these parameters:

* `j_username`: rundeck username
* `j_password`: password

If the response includes a redirect chain which includes or results in `$RUNDECK_SERVER_URL/user/login` or `$RUNDECK_SERVER_URL/user/error`, then the authentication request failed.

Otherwise, if the response is a redirect chain which results in `200 successful` response,  then the authentication was successful.  

The response should set a cookie named `JSESSIONID`.

API Version Number
------

The API Version Number is required to be included in all API calls within the URL.

If the version number is not included or if the requested version number is unsupported, then the API call will fail.


Response Format
------

The XML Response format will conform to this document structure:

    <result success/error="true">
        <!-- error included if error="true" -->
        <error>
            <message><!-- error message text --></message>
            <!-- ... multiple message elements -->
        </error>
        
        <!-- optional success element if declared for the endpoint -->
        <success>
            <message><!-- success message --></message>
        </success>
        
        <!-- 
            Specific API results..
        -->
    </result>

If an error occurred, then the `error` attribute of the `<result>` element will be "true". Otherwise a `success` attribute will have the value "true".

### Item Lists ###

Many API requests will return an item list as a result.  These are typically in the form:

    <[items] count="x">
        <[item] ...>
        <[item] ...>
    </[items]>

Where the list of specific items are wrapped in a pluralized element name which contains a `count` attribute.

When an API path declares its results as an "Item List" this is the format that will be returned.


API Contents
-----

### Updating and Listing Resources for a Project

Update or retrieve the Resources for a project.  A GET request returns the resources
for the project, and a POST request will update the resources.

URL:

    /project/NAME/resources

Method: POST, GET

#### POST request

POSTing to this URL will set the resources for the project to the content of the request.

Expected POST Content: either `text/xml` or `text/yaml` Content-Type containing the 
Resource Model definition in [resources-v10(5)](resources-v10.html) or [resources-v10-yaml(5)](resources-v10-yaml.html) formats as the request body. (Note: any MIME type ending with '/yaml' or '/x-yaml' or '/xml' will be accepted).

POST Result: A success or failure API response. (See [Response Format](#response-format)).

Example POST request:

    POST /api/1/project/test/resources
    Content-Type: text/yaml
    
    node1:
      hostname: node1
      username: bob
    
    node2:
      hostname: node2
      username: bob

Result:

    200 OK
    
    <result success="true">
        <success>
            <message>Resources were successfully updated for project test</message>
        </success>
    </result>

#### GET request

Optional GET Parameters:

* `format` : Result format.  One of "xml" or "yaml". Default is "xml".
*  Query 
parameters can also be used. This is an alternate interface to [Listing Resources](#listing-resources).

GET Result: Depending on the `format` parameter, a value of "xml" will return [resources-v10(5)](resources-v10.html) and "yaml" will return [resources-v10-yaml(5)](resources-v10-yaml.html) formatted results.

Example GET request:

    GET /api/1/project/test/resources

Response:

    200 OK
    Content-Type: text/xml
    
    <project>
        <node name="node1" hostname="node1" username="bob" />
        <node name="node2" hostname="node2" username="bob" />
    </project>

### Refreshing Resources for a Project

Refresh the resources for a project via its Resource Model Provider URL. The URL can be
specified as a request parameter, or the pre-configured URL for the project
can be used.

URL:

    /project/NAME/resources/refresh

Method: POST

Optional Parameters:

`providerURL`

:   Specify the Resource Model Provider URL to refresh the resources from.  If 
    not specified then the configured provider URL in the `project.properties`
    file will be used.

Result: A success or failure result with a message.

### Listing History

List the event history for a project.

URL:

    /history

Required Parameters:

* `project` : project name

Optional Parameters:

* History query parameters:
    * `jobIdFilter`: include events for a job ID.
    * `reportIdFilter`: include events for an event Name.
    * `userFilter`: include events created by a user
    * `statFilter`: include events based on result status.  this can be 'succeed','fail', or 'cancel'.
* Date query parameters:
    * `recentFilter`: Use a simple text format to filter events that occured within a period of time. The format is "XY" where X is an integer, and "Y" is one of:
        * `h`: hour
        * `d`: day
        * `w`: week
        * `m`: month
        * `y`: year
        So a value of "2w" would return events within the last two weeks.
    * `begin`: Specify exact date for earliest result.
    * `end`: Specify exact date for latest result.
* Paging parameters:
    * `max`: indicate the maximum number of events to return. The default maximum to return is 20.
    * `offset`: indicate the 0-indexed offset for the first event to return.

The format for the `end`, and `begin` filters is either:  a unix millisecond timestamp, or a W3C dateTime string in the format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ".

Result:  an Item List of `events`.  Each `event` has this form:

    <event starttime="[unixtime]" endtime="[unixtime]">
      <title>[job title, or "adhoc"]</title>
      <status>[status]</status>
      <summary>[summary text]</summary>
      <node-summary succeeded="[X]" failed="[Y]" total="[Z]"/>
      <user>[user]</user>
      <project>[project]</project>
      <date-started>[start date]</date-started>
      <date-ended>[end date]</date-ended>
      <!-- if the execution was aborted, the username who aborted it: -->
      <abortedby>[username]</abortedby>
      <!-- if associated with an Execution, include the execution id: -->
      <execution id="[execid]"/>
      <!-- if associated with a Job, include the Job ID: -->
      <job id="[jobid]"/>
    </event>

The `events` element will also have `max`, `offset`, and `total` attributes, to indicate the state of paged results.  E.G:

    <events count="8" total="268" max="20" offset="260">
    ...
    </events>

`total` is the total number of events matching the query parameters.
`count` is the number of events included in the results.
`max` is the paging size as specified in the request, or with the default value of 20.
`offset` is the offset specified, or default value of 0.

### Creating History Event Reports

Create a history event report for any external process.

URL:

    /report/create

Required Parameters:

* `project` : project name
* `status` : report status, one of "succeeded", "failed" or "aborted"
* `title` : Title of the report. This should be a short string identifying the process that was run.  E.g. RunDeck jobs use the Job Group and Job Name, and adhoc commands use the string "adhoc".
* `summary` : A descriptive summary of the result.
* `nodesuccesscount`:  number of successful nodes: how many nodes the process succeeded on.
* `nodefailedcount`: number of failed nodes: how many nodes the process failed on.

Optional Parameters:

* `start`: Specify exact date for beginning of the process (defaults to the same as end).
* `end`: Specify exact date for end of the process (defaults to time the report is received).
* `script`: Full adhoc command or script that was run, if applicable.
* `jobID`: Any associated RunDeck Job ID
* `execID`: Any associated RunDeck Execution ID.

The format for the `end`, and `start` values is either:  a unix millisecond timestamp, or a W3C dateTime string in the format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ".

### Listing Resources

List or query the resources for a project.

URL:

    /resources

Required Parameters:

* `project` : project name

Optional Parameters:

* `format` : Result format.  One of "xml" or "yaml". Default is "xml".

* Node Filter parameters: You can select resources to include and exclude in the result set, see [Using Node Filters](#using-node-filters) below.

**Note:** If no query parameters are included, the result set will include all Node resources for the project.

Result: Depending on the `format` parameter, a value of "xml" will return [resources-v10(5)](resources-v10.html) and "yaml" will return [resources-v10-yaml(5)](resources-v10-yaml.html) formatted results.

#### Using Node Filters

To include certain resources, specify the inclusion filters:

* `hostname`, `tags`, `os-[name,family,arch,version]`, `name`

To exclude certain resources, specify the exclusion filters as above but with `exclude-` prepended:

* `exclude-hostname`, `exclude-tags`, etc..

To specify which type of filter (inclusion or exclusion) takes precedence, specify:

* `exclude-precedence` : Whether exclusion filters take precedence. "true"/"false" (default is "true").

If using only inclusion filters, the result set will be only those resources which *do* match the filters.

If using only exclusion filters, the result set will be only those resources which *do not* match the filters.

When using both types of filters, the result will depend on the `exclude-precedence` value (default true).

* When `exclude-precedence` is true:  
    1. First select the resources which *do not* match the **exclusion** filters.
    2. Then select from those the resources which *do* match the **inclusion** filters.

* When `exclude-precedence` is false:
    1. First select all resources.
    2. Then remove the resources which *do not* match the **exclusion** filters.
    3. Then add the resources which *do* match the **inclusion** filters.

The difference between these results is apparent when you have resources which are matched by both the exclusion and the inclusion filters.  The precedence determines whether those resources are included or not.

Using set logic, if "A" is the set of all resources, "X" is the set of all resources matching the exclusion filters, and "I" is the set of all resources matching the inclusion filters, then:

* when `exclude-precedence=true` then the result is: 
    * $( A - X ) \cap I$
    * which is also $I - X$
* when `exclude-precedence=false` then the result is: 
    * $( A - X ) \cup I$

### Getting Resource Info

Get a specific resource within a project.

URL:

    /resource/[name]

Required Parameters:

* `project` : project name

Optional Parameters:

* `format` : Result format.  One of "xml" or "yaml". Default is "xml".

Result: Depending on the `format` parameter, a value of "xml" will return [resources-v10(5)](resources-v10.html) and "yaml" will return [resources-v10-yaml(5)](resources-v10-yaml.html) formatted results.

The result will contain a single item for the specified resource.
