## Profile

1. The user profile allows you to set an email address for this user. This email
address can be referenced as a [context variable](jobs.html#context-variables)
from Job notifications as `job.user.email`.

2. The "Groups" section contains a list of user groups the authentication service has been configured for the user. This is important when setting up or checking ACL policies.

3. Use the "API Tokens" to list, generate or remove api tokens.
