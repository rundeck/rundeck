## Accessibility

### Screen Reader
TabView container is defined with the `tablist` role, as any attribute is passed to the container element `aria-labelledby` can be optionally used to specify an element to describe the TabView. Each tab header has a `tab` role along with `aria-selected` state attribute and `aria-controls` to refer to the corresponding tab content element. The content element of each tab has `tabpanel` role, an id to match the `aria-controls` of the header and `aria-labelledby` reference to the header as the accessible <name></name>
