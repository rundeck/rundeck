/**
 * ThreadBoundOutputStream allows a different OutputStream to be used for the current Thread and any child threads when
 * necessary, otherwise the default OutputStream is used.  This is useful for replacing System.err or System.out to
 * capture output in a multi-threaded system, allowing using different sink OutputStreams for each Thread (and their
 * sub-threads). <br> Convenience methods {@link #bindSystemOut()} and {@link #bindSystemErr()} allow easy replacement
 * of the System.out and System.err printstreams, and access to the ThreadBoundOutputStream at any time after doing so.
 * <br> Setting the correct OutputStream should be done with {@link #installThreadStream(java.io.OutputStream)}, and
 * removed with {@link #removeThreadStream()}. <br> Example code which replaces System.out and sets a two different
 * FileOutputStreams as the sinks for System.out for multpile threads:
 * <pre>
 * public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
 *     //bind to System.out, or retrieve already bound instance
 *     final ThreadBoundOutputStream newout = ThreadBoundOutputStream.bindSystemOut();
 *
 *     //start another thread which redirect System.out to a file
 *     Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable(){
 *         public void run() {
 *             try {
 *                 newout.installThreadStream(new FileOutputStream("thread1.output"));
 *                 method1("thread1"); //writes to the thread1.output file
 *             } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { }
 *         }
 *     });
 * 
 *     t1.start();
 *     method1("main"); //prints to original System.out
 * }
 * public static void method1(String thread) {
 *     //pre-existing code which writes to System.out
 *     System.out.println("This output will be written to the correct outputstream in thread: " + thread);
 * }
 * </pre>
