# Rundeck Plugin Examples (Outdated)
_Updated 2022-10-01_
Historically, example plugin code has existed in this folder. However, this code is in need of a refresh to come into alignment with our new plugin development guidelines (coming soon).

To that end, you'll see these examples disappear over time as they are migrated to the new [rundeck-plugin-examples repo](https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck-plugin-examples). In the meantime, you can keep using these examples as a loose guideline of how to produce our different types of plugins for your Rundeck instance.
